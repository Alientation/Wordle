# Wordle (NOT FINISHED)
A custom GUI libary with Wordle to display it's features

## Introduction
The project aims at emulating XCode's gui framework by having a short unique set of bare bone gui containers which could then be easily modified by the user thereby giving them a greater sense of control. 

I have currently halted this project in favor of a full rewrite of the GUI library to apply software design techniques to optimize development. The new rewrite can be viewed in the 'AlienGUI' repo.

## Inspiration
This project was heavily inspired by XCode and how it managed gui containers for IOS apps
