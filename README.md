# Wordle
A custom gui libary with wordle to display it's features

## Introduction
The project aims at emulating XCode's gui framework by having a short unique set of bare bone gui containers which could then be easily modified by the user thereby giving them a greater sense of control. I have currently put this project on pause but definitely look forward to returning after exam season.

## Technologies
* JavaSE 14

## Inspiration
This project was heavily inspired by XCode and how it managed gui containers in mobile app development
